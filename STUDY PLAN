Nonlinear optimisation 
_______________________________________________________
The aim of the course is to give a good theoretical foundation for some of 
the most important areas of optimisation: convex optimisation, linear optimisation,
and nonlinear optimisation. The course treats the basics principles for analyzing 
the properties of an optimisation problem, and the characterization of feasible 
points that are (locally) optimal. This theory is used to develop a number of examples 
of optimisation methods, that can be used to solve instances of practical optimisation
problem. The course also aims to give some practical training in mathematical modelling
and problem solving using optimisation.
# state and explain the most important concepts in convex analysis, convex optimization, and duality, and be able to apply the theory on concrete examples.
# state and explain the basics of necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, in particular the KKT conditions, and be able to utilize the theory to analyze and solve concrete examples.
# analyze linear programming problems using concepts such as duality and sensitivity; solve linear programming programs using the simplex method and explain how the method works.
# explain notions such as descent and feasible direction, and use these concepts to explain the principles behind, to analyze, and to apply classical optimization methods, e.g., steepest descent, variations of Newton's method, the Frank-Wolfe method, and penalty methods; be able to specify conditions under which these methods converge.
# formulate relevant parts of a real-world problem in terms of a mathematical optimization model, analyze the model using appropriate tools and methods, and apply appropriate solution algorithms.
# This basic course in optimization describes the most relevant mathematical principles that are used to analyze and solve optimization problems in continuous variables. A rough separation and overview of the content is as follows.
# Convex analysis: convex set, polytope, polyhedron, cone, representation theorem, extreme point, Farkas Lemma, convex function
# Optimality conditions and duality: global/local optimum, existence and uniqueness of optimal solutions, variational inequality, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, complementarity conditions, Lagrange multiplier, Lagrangian dual problem, global optimality conditions, weak/strong duality
# Linear programming (LP): LP models, LP algebra and geometry, basic feasible solution (BFS), the Simplex method, LP duality, optimality conditions, strong duality, complementarity, interior point methods, sensitivity analysis
# Nonlinear optimization methods: direction of descent, line search, (quasi-)Newton methods, Frank--Wolfe method, gradient projection, exterior and interior penalty methods.
